# RiskyRopes 

Game here: https://www.roblox.com/games/6541854544/Risky-Ropes-Labs

Very incomplete rewrite of Risky Ropes

All the original levels and skins will not be distributed here.

## Getting Started
To build the place from scratch, use:

```bash
rojo build -o "riskyropes.rbxlx"
```

Next, open `riskyropes.rbxlx` in Roblox Studio and start the Rojo server:

```bash
rojo serve
```

For more help, check out [the Rojo documentation](https://rojo.space/docs).
